## CI/CD Pipelines 

A CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline is a series of automated steps that enable developers to build, test, and deploy code changes efficiently and reliably. The pipeline is a core component of modern DevOps practices, ensuring that software is delivered quickly, with high quality, and with minimal manual intervention.



## Steps 


### add .github/workflows directory

The .github/workflows directory is a special folder in your GitHub repository where you store workflow files for GitHub Actions.

Workflow files are written in YAML format (e.g., ci-cd-pipeline.yml) and define the steps for your CI/CD pipeline.

   - Create the .github Folder
     ```
     mkdir .github
     ```

   - Create the workflows Folder inside .github folder
   - Create the Workflow File called ci-cd-pipeline.yml inside 
     ./workflows
